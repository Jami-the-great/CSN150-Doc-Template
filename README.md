## Steps I followed
1. Installing the Arduino IDE ( https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). 
2. Installing the USB-to-Serial Bridge Driver ([CH340 drivers](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html)
3. Installing the ESP32 Arduino Core [File>preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json)
4. Selecting the Board and Port (Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino and select AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM)
5. Add CallMeBot number to phone contacts (+34 684 73 40 44) and sent activation message via WhatsApp:
'I allow callmebot to send me messages'
6. Waited for API key response from CallMeBot via WhatsApp.
7. Programmed the ESP32-CAM-MB with Arduino code to connect to WiFi and send HTTP GET requests to CallMeBot API including phone number, message, and API key.
8. Opened Serial Monitor (baud rate 115200) to check connection and API response.

## How I Used the Code to Send WhatsApp Messages from ESP32-CAM-MB

1. Set up WiFi connection

   #In the Arduino sketch, I configured the ESP32-CAM-MB to connect to my WiFi network by providing my SSID and password.

3. Constructed the API URL

##I built the CallMeBot API URL string using my phone number (without the + sign), the message I wanted to send (URL-encoded), and my API key received from CallMeBot.

4. Used HTTPClient library

###The code uses the ESP32 HTTPClient library to perform an HTTP GET request to the CallMeBot API endpoint with the constructed URL.

5. Sent the GET request

####I triggered the HTTP GET request from the ESP32 to the CallMeBot server.

6. Handled the server response

#####The ESP32 reads the HTTP response code and prints it to the Serial Monitor for debugging.

7. My Message For the message, I used:

 ######("Hello from ESP32 via Jamilex Estevez!") This message was sent directly to my WhatsApp using the CallMeBot API.


## Problems
Note your problems or errors here.  Google any error you may come across, and not what you tried (even if it does not work), and what was the final answer. Document your errors and solutions that worked for you.  

1. CallMeBot number not found on WhatsApp. 

How did I solve: Double checked CallMeBotâ€™s number on their official site. Added the correct one manually. (+34 684 73 40 44)

2.Received HTTP error 203 when sending message indicating possible API key or request format issues.

 How did I solve:  This error occurred because I forgot to add the digit 1 before my U.S. phone number in international format. CallMeBot requires the number to start with the country code like 1917XXXXXXX. Once I fixed that the message went through successfully.



## Final Report
This project showed how easy it is to add messaging functionality to an IoT device like the ESP32-CAM. Even though a small mistake like missing a country code digit caused an error troubleshooting taught me to closely inspect API request formats.
